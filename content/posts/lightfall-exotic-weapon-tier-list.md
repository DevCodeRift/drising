# The Ultimate Lightfall Exotic Weapon Tier List

With Lightfall's release, the exotic weapon landscape has shifted dramatically. New weapons have entered the fray while others have received significant updates. This comprehensive tier list evaluates every exotic weapon's performance in both PvP and PvE contexts.

## Methodology

Our rankings consider multiple factors:

- **Raw damage output** and DPS potential
- **Versatility** across different content types
- **Ease of use** and accessibility
- **Synergy** with current subclasses and builds
- **Meta relevance** in endgame content

*Tier lists are inherently subjective and depend heavily on playstyle preferences. These rankings represent general consensus from high-level players and content creators.*

## S-Tier: The Absolute Best

### Gjallarhorn
*"Eyes up, Guardian."*

The king of exotic heavy weapons maintains its crown in Lightfall.

**Why it's S-Tier:**
- Unmatched burst damage for raid encounters
- Pack Hunter perk benefits entire fireteam
- Excellent for both add-clear and boss damage
- Works in virtually every PvE activity

**Best Used For:** Raids, dungeons, high-level Nightfalls

### Osteo Striga
*"What does not kill you makes you stronger."*

This exotic submachine gun continues to dominate both PvP and PvE.

**Strengths:**
- Incredible add-clear potential
- Poison spreads create area denial in PvP
- Pairs beautifully with Necrotic Grip
- Catalyst significantly improves reload speed

### Witherhoard
*"A weapon born from the Hive's understanding of physics."*

The versatility champion that excels everywhere.

**Why it's essential:**
- Passive damage allows weapon swapping
- Area denial in both PvP and PvE
- Excellent for solo content
- Synergizes with breach and clear mods

## A-Tier: Excellent Choices

### Arbalest
Linear fusion rifle that breaks through any shield type.

**Key Features:**
- Anti-barrier intrinsic
- Breaks all shield types in one shot
- High damage output
- Essential for Match Game activities

### Loreley Splendor Helm + Any Solar Weapon
While not technically a weapon, this combination defines the meta.

### Ace of Spades
The hand cannon that never goes out of style.

**PvP Performance:** Exceptional
**PvE Performance:** Solid

## B-Tier: Solid Performers

### Trinity Ghoul
*"Three points define a plane, unless they are collinear."*

The arc bow that creates chain lightning.

*Requires the catalyst to truly shine. Without it, Trinity Ghoul drops to C-tier.*

**Pros:**
- Incredible add-clear with catalyst
- Satisfying chain lightning effects
- Good ammo economy

**Cons:**
- Struggles against high-health targets
- Requires precision to activate Lightning Rod

## Weapon Synergies

### Top Combinations

**Gjallarhorn** + Explosive Light mods = Perfect for Raids
**Osteo Striga** + Necrotic Grip = Dominates all content
**Witherhoard** + Auto-loading holster weapons = Solo play excellence
**Arbalest** + Elemental wells builds = Nightfall champion

## PvP vs PvE Rankings

### PvP S-Tier
1. **The Last Word** - Unmatched close-range dueling
2. **Ace of Spades** - Versatile hand cannon excellence
3. **Lorentz Driver** - Linear fusion domination

### PvE S-Tier
1. **Gjallarhorn** - Raid boss destroyer
2. **Witherhoard** - Versatility incarnate
3. **Osteo Striga** - Add-clear champion

*Remember that personal skill and playstyle matter more than tier lists. A weapon you can use effectively is better than a highly-ranked weapon you struggle with.*

## Seasonal Considerations

### Artifact Mods Impact

The seasonal artifact heavily influences weapon viability:

- **Anti-Champion mods** determine which weapons shine in high-level content
- **Elemental well mods** affect energy weapon choices
- **Damage type focuses** shift the meta periodically

### Activity-Specific Recommendations

#### Grandmaster Nightfalls
1. Arbalest (Anti-barrier)
2. Divinity (Support)
3. Gjallarhorn (Boss damage)

#### Trials of Osiris
1. The Last Word
2. Ace of Spades
3. Lorentz Driver

#### Raid Encounters
1. Gjallarhorn
2. Divinity
3. Xenophage

## Conclusion

The Lightfall exotic weapon meta rewards versatility and team play. While individual weapons may excel in specific scenarios, the most valuable exotics are those that perform well across multiple content types.

### Key Takeaways

- **Gjallarhorn remains king** for PvE content
- **Osteo Striga** offers incredible versatility
- **Arbalest** is essential for endgame content
- **Playstyle matching** beats tier list following

Remember to experiment with different combinations and find what works best for your preferred activities and playstyle. The "best" weapon is always the one that helps you and your fireteam succeed.
